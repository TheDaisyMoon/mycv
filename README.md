My curriculum vitae done in HTML/CSS... (for now)

I just thought making updating my CV a coding exercise was a good idea. So now I've just used HTML and CSS. I'll continue changing it when I'll learn something that is usefull to make it better. 

It is in French. The English version will come, but I am told cv are not done the same way outside of France so I need to educate myself more on that. 

Please feel free to comment or give suggestions !
